# A script that notifies you when there is a free slot for the naturalisation

A script that periodically queries the website of the prefecture until there is a free slot for a naturalisation rendez-vous.
Once the website shows a calendar instead of the typical message prompting you to re-try later, the Marselleise is played so that you can hurry up and complete the process (the script cannot do that for you)
